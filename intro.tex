\section*{Introduction}
The ability to judge the likelihood of a severe traffic accident given the weather and road conditions has a number of useful applications. One potential use of this information would be warning drivers of unsafe driving conditions on their route. Another might be automatic recommendation of speed limit adjustments on roads where this is possible. This project seeks to use machine learning to determine if weather and road conditions can be used to predict the likelihood of severe accidents occuring.
