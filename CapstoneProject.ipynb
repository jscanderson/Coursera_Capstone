One potential use of this information would be warning drivers of unsafe driving conditions on their route. Another might be automatic recommendation of speed limit adjustments on roads where this is possible. This project seeks to use machine learning to determine if weather and road conditions can be used to predict the likelihood of increased accident severity."

This data set provides a set of descriptive features of each collision, as well as the environment where each collision occured, such as weather and road conditions. The data is labeled with a number from 0 to 3 indicating the severity of each collision. To predict whether a collision that occurs has a high probability of being severe, I will use the environmental features of this data set as well as the severity labels to train a machine learning model."
