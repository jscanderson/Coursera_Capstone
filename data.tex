\section*{Data}
This project will use a data set of traffic collisions recorded by the Seattle Police Department and Traffic Records (the data set provided by the course). This data set provides a set of descriptive features of each collision, as well as the environment where each collision occured, such as weather and road conditions. The data is labeled with a number from 0 to 3 indicating the severity of each collision. To predict whether a collision that occurs has a high probability of being severe, I will use the environmental features of this data set as well as the severity labels to train a machine learning model.
